# #0x0F. Star Wars API
## In this project, I write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:
* The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: 3 = “Return of the Jedi”
* One character is displayed name per line in the same order as the “characters” list in the /films/ endpoint
* This is made using the [Star wars API](https://swapi.dev/)
* The API is parsed with the request module

# #0x10. Rain
## In this project, I create a function where given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls calculates how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

* Prototype: def rain(walls)
* walls is a list of non-negative integers.
* Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
* This function assumes that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
* If the list is empty return 0.

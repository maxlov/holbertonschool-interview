# #0x11. Heap sort
## In this project, I write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

* Prototype: void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size)
* This is implemented in the sift-down heap sort algorithm
* The array is printed after each time you swap two elements
